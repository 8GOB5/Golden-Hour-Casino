## Overview

This script automates slot machine interactions within the Golden Hour Hotel's Casino. You lazy gambling addict. It works really well. I've made 2 million already.

## Features

- **Automated Slot Interaction**: Automatically plays 1C, 10C, and 100C slot machines.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Intuitive interface to control automation settings.
- **Individual Slot Control**: Enable or disable automation for specific slot types.
- **Global Toggle**: Activate or deactivate all slot automations simultaneously.
- **Script Termination**: Easily stop the script and remove the GUI when desired.

## How It Works

Upon execution, the script displays a GUI with options to toggle automation for each slot type:

- **1C Slot Automation**: Toggles automation for 1-chip slot machines.
- **10C Slot Automation**: Toggles automation for 10-chip slot machines.
- **100C Slot Automation**: Toggles automation for 100-chip slot machines.
- **Toggle All Slots**: Simultaneously toggles automation for all slot types.
- **Destroy**: Terminates the script and removes the GUI from the screen.

The script continuously searches for slot machines in the game environment and interacts with them at regular intervals to simulate player engagement.

## Usage

1. **Execution**: Run the script in the Golden Hour Hotel's Casino.
2. **GUI Interaction**: Use the on-screen buttons to control slot automation:

   - Use the "Toggle All Slots" button to control all slot automations simultaneously.
   - Click "Destroy" to stop the script and remove the GUI.
